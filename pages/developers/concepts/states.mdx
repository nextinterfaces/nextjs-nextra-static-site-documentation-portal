# States

States provide a way to store and manage conversational context within a chatbot integration.

These are used to remember the status of various conversations and users interacting with the bot, helping to create a more fluid and personalized user experience.

State data can include details such as the current point in a conversation, the user's previous interactions, or any other information that needs to be stored temporarily for the ongoing conversation. This allows the bot to respond appropriately based on the context of the conversation.

Here's a basic outline of how states might be represented in your chatbot integration:

## getUserState

This function retrieves the current state for a specific user. This could include user-specific information, such as past interactions or user preferences.

## getConversationState

This function retrieves the current state of a particular conversation. This might include the current step in the conversation flow or any other relevant conversation-level information.

## updateUserState

This function updates the state data for a specific user.

## updateConversationState

This function updates the state data for a specific conversation.

## Example - usage of states

Here's a simple example of what the state management methods might look like in your chatbot integration:

```javascript
const integration = {
  // ...
  states: {
    getUserState: async (ctx, userId) => {
      // Implement logic to retrieve the current state for the user
    },
    getConversationState: async (ctx, conversationId) => {
      // Implement logic to retrieve the current state for the conversation
    },
    updateUserState: async (ctx, userId, newState) => {
      // Implement logic to update the state for the user
    },
    updateConversationState: async (ctx, conversationId, newState) => {
      // Implement logic to update the state for the conversation
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

In these examples, each method accepts the context **ctx**, which is used for storing and retrieving application-level data.

**userId** and **conversationId** identify the user and conversation whose state is to be retrieved or updated, respectively.
**newState** represents the updated state data.

Remember that state management is crucial for ensuring that your chatbot can provide contextually appropriate responses and maintain a coherent and engaging conversation with users.
