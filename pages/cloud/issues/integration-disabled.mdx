# Integration Disabled

## About this Issue
This Issue arises when your Bot tries to use an **Integration** that has been **disabled or deleted**. This can happen if you disabled or deleted the Integration after your Bot was deployed. This Issue can also if you deploy an [imported Bot](../studio/import-export) without configuring the required integrations that this Bot uses.

## Resolution
Make sure the Integrations required by your Bot are properly configured. If any required Integrations are disabled, you must enable them.
