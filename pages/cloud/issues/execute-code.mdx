# Execute Code

## About this issue

This issue arises when an **unhandled exception** is thrown by JavaScript code in an **Execute Code** card, triggering the **Error flow** for your bot. You can inspect the [Logs](../admin-dashboard/logs) to see details about the exception.


## Resolution
You can wrap your code in a [`try..catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) statement and handle the exception. This will ensure the Error flow is not triggered.
